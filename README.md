# Language Complexity

A python package to compute typology-oriented information-based language complexity metrics from written text samples, using compression algorithms.

## Example Usage

```python
from lang_complexity.complexity import complexities
metric = complexities["morphology_deletion_gzip"]
metric.compute("This is only a sample text.")
```
